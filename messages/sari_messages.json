Here is a quick high level list of Tours & adventures: scuba diving, snorkeling, hol chan marine reserve, bacalar chico, mexico rocks, blue hole, cave tubing,  Mayan ruins, the zoo (hand feed the jaguars), parasailing, jet skiing, fishing,  fly-fishing, spear fishing,  kayaking, paddleboard, deep sea and game fishing, caye hop, feed the tarpons, croc or wildlife tours,  snorkel or swim with manatees (mother nature permitting), Grand Slam,  Beach BBQ,  and more! ..Here is more of a Breakdown for some Belize Adventure Highlights:..MAYAN RUIN, Lamanai:.Lamanai Mayan Ruins, on this trip, you get picked up on property at 5am, head to the city where a van awaits to take you 54 miles on the Northern highway, at the end of this ride, you will get on a riverboat and go down the river, where if mother nature allows you will see, spider monkeys, howler monkeys, birds, crocodiles, manatees, butterflies, and lots of flora and fauna, after the boat ride, you will hike for 20 minutes and see the Maya Ruin, Lamanai.Cost: 280 USD per person, plus taxes. Picks up at the property and includes, breakfast, and lunch..MAYA RUIN XUNATUNICH, CAVE TUBING, ZIP LINING AND/OR THE BELIZE ZOO (3 IN 1 DAY):.The Maya Ruin Xunatunich Ruins adventure can be joined with either Cave tubing or zip lining, the cost of the two in one day can go up to 300 depending on what you want to do. You can also do a 3 in 1 day and choose from the Mayan ruins, cave tubing, zip lining or the zoo (for an extra fee you can hand feed the jaguars at the zoo,  really neat for big animal lovers). This includes breakfast and lunch...HOL CHAN, SHARK RAY ALLEY:.Snorkeling at holchan and shark ray alley can be done via catamaran for a full day or on a speed boat with pick up from the property for 1/2 day. I always encourage pick up tours...CAYE CAULKER SAIL:.On this trip, you will snorkel at two sites, holchan marine reserve, and Shark Ray Alley (swim with sharks and sting rays). Then you'll head to our beautiful neighboring island Caye Caulker where you will have lunch (not included) and visit the island..Then you'll head back to the boat where you'll enjoy the music and those delicious rum punches!.The cost is $95 plus taxes & park fees, per person.Pick up at 8:30 am and drop off at 4:30 pm (pick up not included since its on a catamaran, must go into town)..SPEED BOAT - Private TOUR.8:30am or 1:30pm pick up.Head to holchan and shark ray alley.Cost is 75 plus park fees & taxes..THE GRAND SLAM - .Cost $175 per person, need a minimum of 4 people to confirm: this is on a speed boat..8 am & returns at 4 pm.Snorkel at Holchan, Shark Ray Alley & the north channel in Caye Caulker (high chance of snorkeling with manatees and sea horses mother nature permitting), feed the tarpons and stop for lunch (not included)..BEACH BBQ: .My personal top favorite, is the Beach BBQ day, the cost is $650 plus taxes..On this day you'll Snorkel, Fish, Spearfish, Lobster Hunt, Conch Hunt (Only if in season) and have a Beach BBQ cookout on a private beach & enjoy your catch! Ceviche Belizean grilled fish, Rum punches & more! .Price remains the same if 1 or 4 persons go, after 4 then the cost is 95 USD per additional person"

We will be looking at renting paddle boards or maybe kayaks. Would either work for us to get to the reef for snorkeling and can we anchor or tie up to a bouy near the reef?   Also, we would like to get to the Great Blue hole for a dive if possible, my scuba certification has lapsed, so don't know what the possibilities are. Two of us would snorkel. Possibly a day in Caye Caulker and a day seeing the ruins. Any local hikes? Finally, we will take advantage of the chef at the villa a night or two.

You'll fish 2 different locations, and snorkel in different locations, while snorkeling you'll hunt for conch (if in season) and spearfish - once your boating adventure is complete, you'll dock on a private beach and the Boat Captain, and your chef will prepare your catch - and you will eat your catch! :)"

You'll head outside the international airport. Here you will see a variety of taxi cabs willing to take you to the water taxi terminal in Belize City (we can arrange this for you) and have our driver waiting for you. The cost on the taxi cab is approximately 25.00 US for two persons and 10 US Dollars per additional person..After the 40 Minute taxi ride, you will get to the water taxi where Nelson will purchase your water taxi tickets, the cost on this is 45 US Dollars round trip per person. If you purchase yourself is 55 US round trip.  The ferry is about 1 hr and 40 minutes ride to the island. You will pay your driver cash directly for transport and tickets. ..Plane:.Once you have arrived at the International airport in Belize City and cleared customs this is what will happen if you choose to come via plane. Inside the International airport you will walk through double doors and head directly to your left you will see a kiosk that says Tropic Air, the cost is about 168.00 US Dollars round trip to San Pedro and back to the international airport per person. We will reserve your flights in advance and you will pay at the desk upon arrival directly.  The flights leave every hour on the hour from San Pedro to Belize City and Belize City to the island. If you're flights delayed,  we can adjust your flights for you while you're traveling. Technically you should be at the airport 2 hours before departing back stateside, but you can push this to an hour and 15 comfortably. The flight itself is a beautiful low flying 15 minutes over the Caribbean. If you board first, you can sit next to the pilot! This feels like a mini tour in and of itself - makes for gorgeous photos.  Totally worth the flight plus makes for a much shorter travel day. ..Once you decide how you wish to come down to the island, Ms. Terri will book for you.  All we need is your international flights and we're more than happy to book a flight for you or water taxi...When you rent a golf cart with us,  Upon arrival on island,  Ms. Terri will greet you in arrival,  escort you through town and stop at the store,  time permitting and escort you to the villa.   ..When booking your international flights, try to select flights with earliest arrival options and latest departures.

This cost is 25 US Dollars for two persons and 10 US Dollars per additional person, the travel time from the water taxi to the cab is 30 minutes. So in all, you will add almost 3 hrs more of traveling...The second method is via plane, the cost is 168.50 US Dollars. Yes, this is the most expensive one but the least amount of travel time, the flight is only 15 minutes...For both of these I am more than happy to book it for you, just let me know. ..Once on the island, you will need a golf cart, the cost of a golf cart is 225 US Dollars for the entire week, plus taxes, once you rent a golf cart with us, I will be waiting for you at either the San Pedro Airport or the San Pedro Water taxi marina and leading the way to the villa...If you have any other questions, please do let us know"

(lunch not included)  We then go to feed the tarpons and the last snorkel site will be at the north channel in caye caulker, where if mother nature allows us, you will snorkel with manatees and sea horses..The cost per person is 165 US dollars plus taxes, we do need a minimum of 4 persons to confirm this trip...On the fishing, you can either do a half day fishing for 450 plus taxes or a full day fishing for 650 plus taxes. This price is for the boat and additional persons pay 95 plus taxes...If you want fishing, you can also do a day at sea which includes, fishing, lobster and conch hunting (if in season), snorkeling and a cook off on the beach of everything you caught.

    "content": "Hello Sari, ..When we first arrived in Belize, I made sure to ask Terri what time we should take the ferry (which we bought a round trip ticket for to save some $) back to BZE for our noon international flight. She said we have to leave the villa no later than 6am. This was also confirmed with her the afternoon prior to departure via WhatsApp. The morning of our departure turned out chaotic. We planned to catch the 7am ferry to Belize City. We didn’t leave the villa until 6:15 because we had to do the final paperwork to pay for our golf cart and wait for Terri to refuel hers. Upon arrival on 9/22, I asked if we could take care of our golf cart paperwork ahead of time, but Terri said it needed to be done closer to our departure date. Instead of alotting extra time for that the morning   of our departure, or even scheduling a time for us to come in the day before, it was initiated at 6 am — the time we were already supposed to be on the road & therefore setting us behind schedule. On the way to the boat dock, Terri decided to give a young girl a ride into town without consulting with us. This indicated a lack of concern for our time. Not only were we already running behind, but picking up the girl to drop her off at an undisclosed location only added to our stress and worry. We understand that it is customary for the locals but we didn’t really have the luxury of time at this point. Needless to say, we missed the 7am ferry by a few minutes. The next one would’ve been at 8:30am. Too late to check in for our noon flight by the time the ferry docks, collect our luggage and take a cab to the airport. Terri said she thought that the ferry would at least wait for us, which we were never under the impression that it would. Plus, that shouldn’t have been a concern since the mutual understanding was to be on time. Terri then suggested we take Maya Air to make our international flight flight by noon. An expense we didn’t foresee nor budgeted for. We had no choice but to purchase our ticket for Maya Air. We would appreciate it if you would reimburse us our ferry tickets and Maya Air tickets with a total of $295.00. This was truly an inconvenience and has put a damper on our trip. ..Thank you...Trish and Da’nelle"
