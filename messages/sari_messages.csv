The flights leave every hour on the hour from San Pedro to Belize City and Belize City to the island. The flight itself is a beautiful low flying 15 minutes over the Caribbean. If you board first, you can sit next to the pilot!..Once you decide how you wish to come down to the island, I am more than happy to book a flight for you or water taxi.",2023-01-26 19:39:00
1387759478,Glenda,Hello Terri! We are also interested in having a boat day. Do you know how we can rent a boat?,2023-01-30 18:54:00
1387759478,Terri,"Here are a few excursions that you can think about and let me know which one you prefer:..HOL CHAN, SHARK RAY ALLEY: .Snorkeling at holchan and shark ray alley can be done via catamaran for a full day or on a speed boat with pick up from the property for 1/2 day. ..CAYE CAULKER SAIL:.On this trip, you will snorkel at two sites, holchan marine reserve, and Shark Ray Alley (swim with sharks and sting rays). Then you'll head to our beautiful neighboring island Caye Caulker where you will have lunch (not included) and visit the island..Then you'll head back to the boat where you'll enjoy the music and those delicious rum punches!.The cost is $95 plus taxes & park fees, per person.Pick up at 8:30 am and drop off at 4:30 pm (pick up not included since its on a catamaran, must go into town)..SPEED BOAT - 1/2 day TOUR .8:30am or 1:30pm pick up.Head to holchan and shark ray alley.Cost is 75 plus park fees & taxes.Pick up in town would be 55 plus taxes & Fees..THE GRAND SLAM -.Cost $175 per person, need a minimum of 4 people to confirm: this is on a speed boat..8 am & returns at 4 pm.Snorkel at Holchan, Shark Ray Alley & the north channel in Caye Caulker (high chance of snorkeling with manatees and sea horses mother nature permitting), feed the tarpons and stop for lunch (not included), plus park fees and taxes..BEACH BBQ:.My personal top favorite, is the Beach BBQ day, the cost is $650 plus taxes..On this day you'll Snorkel, Fish, Spearfish, Lobster Hunt, Conch Hunt (Only if in season) and have a Beach BBQ cookout on a private beach & enjoy your catch! Ceviche Belizean grilled fish, Rum punches & more!.Price remains the same if 1 or 4 persons go, after 4 then the cost is 95 USD per additional person..These are some of the options on full day tours",2023-01-30 20:01:00
1387759478,Terri,"Renting a boat to go on your own is not possible, since one of the major laws in the country of Belize is that you must have a captain boat license issued in Belize. The reason is because of our reef and some parts of the ocean having shallow water and others have coral head just popping out of no where.",2023-01-30 20:02:00
1387759478,Sari,Hi Glenda you can certainly rent a boat with a boat captain for the day as a part of your Belize Adventure! The Grand Slam and Beach BBQ are the best private boat trip experiences!,2023-02-27 10:10:00
1387759478,Terri,"Glenda, just to clarify, if you want to rent a boat for yourself and drive it yourself, which is not allowed in the country of Belize, you will need a Belizean boat captain license. You can do all day private tour on a boat, like Sari mentioned the Grand Slam and the beach bbq are great options",2023-02-27 11:27:00
1387759478,Glenda,Hello! Sorry on the late response! We will clarify about the boat later. But we would like to know if we can ship Amazon packages to the Airbnb? Not sure if that’s a possibility,2023-04-08 20:19:00
1387759478,Sari,"Hi Glenda! I don't know if you can ship to Belize from the US as US Amazon doesn't ship out of the US, you would have to order from Belize Amazon and you'd have to have them sent to town post office.  I don't think it would be cost effective.  Would be best for you to bring with you from the states.",2023-04-08 21:08:00

1278726853,Terri,"The main mode of transportation on the island is via golf cart. Especially with us being 9 miles north, this is the easiest, cheapest and safest way to travel. A taxi cab, will charge you 75 US Dollars for one way to get you to the villa, so a round trip would be 150 US Dollars, in one day. A golf cart on the other hand would be for 386.00 US Dollars plus taxes + 25 for insurance, this is for your entire stay. .Personally this is the method to go. If you want to go to secret beach, a cab charges 100 US Dollars one way on this. This is an approximation, it can be more, depending on the cab driver you get",2023-02-02 17:41:00

1278726853,Michelle,"Thank you so much again for everything!! We loved it so much. Just a quick note to you, I think the pier on the property is supposed to be private? We did notice there were a fair number of people on the pier at any given time who weren't with the Airbnb. For the most part we didn't mind, but a couple times there were groups of men that just sat on the pier fishing and drinking and leering at us. I mean constant, nonstop staring. On the day we had our massages on the beach, even the massage ladies were uncomfortable. Not sure if anything can be done about this, but just wanted to let you know, especially for lady travelers!",2023-02-21 09:09:00

1278859548,Amber,"Hello!  Quick question-we're planning to use our credit card when and where we can and wondered if we should also exchange some USD for BZD's before arriving?  Also, not sure if we ever confirmed that we would like to go ahead and do the Villa pre-stock.  Please let me know if there is anything else we should be thinking about before we head your way.  Hope you've been well :).Thanks!  Amber",2023-01-29 20:22:00

1278859548,Amber,"Hello again!  Doing some research about things to do/see/eat/drink:) and we had a few questions:.We are interested in doing some snorkeling and were wondering about the options you mentioned previously.  How many people are usually on the full day or speed boat 1/2 day options?  .How do we go about using the kayaks or SUP on the property?.Lastly, we remembered that there will be a grocery stop on the way, so we will not need the villa pre-stock.  Okay, I think that covers the questions for now. . .thanks again, Amber & Mike",2023-01-29 22:33:00
1278859548,Terri,"if the tour is on the catamaran, this can take up to 20 persons, if it is on the speed boat 1/2 day there can be up to 15 persons, the beach bbq is more of a private tour and the price is based on 1 or 4 persons on the boat..For the kayaks, you just let me know, we allow you to use it between 8 am and 1 pm, only if weather is permitting...See you soon",2023-01-30 20:22:00

Here is a quick high level list of Tours & adventures: scuba diving, snorkeling, hol chan marine reserve, bacalar chico, mexico rocks, blue hole, cave tubing,  Mayan ruins, the zoo (hand feed the jaguars), parasailing, jet skiing, fishing,  fly-fishing, spear fishing,  kayaking, paddleboard, deep sea and game fishing, caye hop, feed the tarpons, croc or wildlife tours,  snorkel or swim with manatees (mother nature permitting), Grand Slam,  Beach BBQ,  and more! ..Here is more of a Breakdown for some Belize Adventure Highlights:..MAYAN RUIN, Lamanai:.Lamanai Mayan Ruins, on this trip, you get picked up on property at 5am, head to the city where a van awaits to take you 54 miles on the Northern highway, at the end of this ride, you will get on a riverboat and go down the river, where if mother nature allows you will see, spider monkeys, howler monkeys, birds, crocodiles, manatees, butterflies, and lots of flora and fauna, after the boat ride, you will hike for 20 minutes and see the Maya Ruin, Lamanai.Cost: 280 USD per person, plus taxes. Picks up at the property and includes, breakfast, and lunch..MAYA RUIN XUNATUNICH, CAVE TUBING, ZIP LINING AND/OR THE BELIZE ZOO (3 IN 1 DAY):.The Maya Ruin Xunatunich Ruins adventure can be joined with either Cave tubing or zip lining, the cost of the two in one day can go up to 300 depending on what you want to do. You can also do a 3 in 1 day and choose from the Mayan ruins, cave tubing, zip lining or the zoo (for an extra fee you can hand feed the jaguars at the zoo,  really neat for big animal lovers). This includes breakfast and lunch...HOL CHAN, SHARK RAY ALLEY:.Snorkeling at holchan and shark ray alley can be done via catamaran for a full day or on a speed boat with pick up from the property for 1/2 day. I always encourage pick up tours...CAYE CAULKER SAIL:.On this trip, you will snorkel at two sites, holchan marine reserve, and Shark Ray Alley (swim with sharks and sting rays). Then you'll head to our beautiful neighboring island Caye Caulker where you will have lunch (not included) and visit the island..Then you'll head back to the boat where you'll enjoy the music and those delicious rum punches!.The cost is $95 plus taxes & park fees, per person.Pick up at 8:30 am and drop off at 4:30 pm (pick up not included since its on a catamaran, must go into town)..SPEED BOAT - Private TOUR.8:30am or 1:30pm pick up.Head to holchan and shark ray alley.Cost is 75 plus park fees & taxes..THE GRAND SLAM - .Cost $175 per person, need a minimum of 4 people to confirm: this is on a speed boat..8 am & returns at 4 pm.Snorkel at Holchan, Shark Ray Alley & the north channel in Caye Caulker (high chance of snorkeling with manatees and sea horses mother nature permitting), feed the tarpons and stop for lunch (not included)..BEACH BBQ: .My personal top favorite, is the Beach BBQ day, the cost is $650 plus taxes..On this day you'll Snorkel, Fish, Spearfish, Lobster Hunt, Conch Hunt (Only if in season) and have a Beach BBQ cookout on a private beach & enjoy your catch! Ceviche Belizean grilled fish, Rum punches & more! .Price remains the same if 1 or 4 persons go, after 4 then the cost is 95 USD per additional person",2023-01-30 21:05:00

We would fly in to San Pedro from Belize City airport, so any info on that would be helpful. We will be renting golf carts or scooters if available and pricing would be helpful.. We will be looking at renting paddle boards or maybe kayaks. Would either work for us to get to the reef for snorkeling and can we anchor or tie up to a bouy near the reef?   Also, we would like to get to the Great Blue hole for a dive if possible, my scuba certification has lapsed, so don't know what the possibilities are. Two of us would snorkel.

1220581753,Terri,"No problem Birgit, sorry for the delay:.Plane vs Water taxi..Plane:.Once you have arrived at the international airport in Belize City and cleared customs this is what will happen if you choose to come via plane. Inside the international airport you will head directly to your left you will see a kiosk that says Tropic Air, the cost is about 168.50 US Dollars round trip to San Pedro and back to the international airport per person. The flights leave every hour on the hour from Belize City and from the island back to Belize International airport every hours. You need to be at the international airport at least 3 hours prior to your departure from Belize back home. So keep this in mind when booking your flight. Once you have booked your flight, relax and wait, the plane ride is only 15 minutes long, Whoopi!..Water taxi:.Once you have landed at the international airport and finished with the custom department. Please head outside the international airport. Here you will see a variety of taxi cabs willing to take you to the water taxi terminal in Belize City.

1224919335,Sari,"If you want a chef for the week, Ms. Terri can quote with our chef what the cost would be for the week.  What I would suggest is doing Breakfast with our restaurant. And then do dinner service for the week with the chef.  If I may suggest, keeping your lunch option open - this way you can adventure the island and use lunch as a part of this exploration!  This way, you have the best of both worlds!..Some suggestions: There is a fantastic lunch Food Tour where you experience local cuisine in town, one day you may adventure to Secret Beach (where there is a plethora of restaurants), another day I would suggest do the Grand Slam, Caye hop to Caye Caulker and lunch there, and another day - check out the Beach BBQ, where our boat captain will pick you up at the property.  You'll fish 2 different locations, and snorkel in different locations, while snorkeling you'll hunt for conch (if in season) and spearfish - once your boating adventure is complete, you'll dock on a private beach and the Boat Captain, and your chef will prepare your catch - and you will eat your catch! :)",2022-07-09 20:16:00

1253357315,Randy,You two have been awesome so far!,2022-09-01 09:33:00
1253357315,Sari,".You will be flying into the Belize International Airport (Phillip Golson)..Once you arrive at the international airport in Belize, you will have two choices on how to get to the island, water taxi or our domestic flights:..Water taxi:.Once you have landed at the international airport and finished with the custom department. You'll head outside the international airport. Here you will see a variety of taxi cabs willing to take you to the water taxi terminal in Belize City (we can arrange this for you) and have our driver waiting for you. The cost on the taxi cab is approximately 25.00 US for two persons and 10 US Dollars per additional person..After the 40 Minute taxi ride, you will get to the water taxi where Nelson will purchase your water taxi tickets, the cost on this is 45 US Dollars round trip per person. If you purchase yourself is 55 US round trip.  The ferry is about 1 hr and 40 minutes ride to the island. You will pay your driver cash directly for transport and tickets. ..Plane:.Once you have arrived at the International airport in Belize City and cleared customs this is what will happen if you choose to come via plane. Inside the International airport you will walk through double doors and head directly to your left you will see a kiosk that says Tropic Air, the cost is about 168.00 US Dollars round trip to San Pedro and back to the international airport per person. We will reserve your flights in advance and you will pay at the desk upon arrival directly.  The flights leave every hour on the hour from San Pedro to Belize City and Belize City to the island. If you're flights delayed,  we can adjust your flights for you while you're traveling. Technically you should be at the airport 2 hours before departing back stateside, but you can push this to an hour and 15 comfortably. The flight itself is a beautiful low flying 15 minutes over the Caribbean. If you board first, you can sit next to the pilot! This feels like a mini tour in and of itself - makes for gorgeous photos.  Totally worth the flight plus makes for a much shorter travel day. ..Once you decide how you wish to come down to the island, Ms. Terri will book for you.  All we need is your international flights and we're more than happy to book a flight for you or water taxi...When you rent a golf cart with us,  Upon arrival on island,  Ms. Terri will greet you in arrival,  escort you through town and stop at the store,  time permitting and escort you to the villa.   ..When booking your international flights, try to select flights with earliest arrival options and latest departures.

As you know there are two options of coming to the island:.The water taxi is the cheapest option but also the longest one. The cost is 55 US Dollars round trip per person and the boat ride is 1 hr 45 minutes. You will also need to hire a taxi to take you to the water taxi terminal in Belize City. This cost is 25 US Dollars for two persons and 10 US Dollars per additional person, the travel time from the water taxi to the cab is 30 minutes. So in all, you will add almost 3 hrs more of traveling...The second method is via plane, the cost is 168.50 US Dollars. Yes, this is the most expensive one but the least amount of travel time, the flight is only 15 minutes...For both of these I am more than happy to book it for you, just let me know. ..Once on the island, you will need a golf cart, the cost of a golf cart is 225 US Dollars for the entire week, plus taxes, once you rent a golf cart with us, I will be waiting for you at either the San Pedro Airport or the San Pedro Water taxi marina and leading the way to the villa...If you have any other questions, please do let us know",2022-09-17 12:23:00

This price is for the boat and additional persons pay 95 plus taxes...If you want fishing, you can also do a day at sea which includes, fishing, lobster and conch hunting (if in season), snorkeling and a cook off on the beach of everything you caught.

1243852143,Trish,"Hello Sari, ..When we first arrived in Belize, I made sure to ask Terri what time we should take the ferry (which we bought a round trip ticket for to save some $) back to BZE for our noon international flight. She said we have to leave the villa no later than 6am. This was also confirmed with her the afternoon prior to departure via WhatsApp. The morning of our departure turned out chaotic. We planned to catch the 7am ferry to Belize City. We didn’t leave the villa until 6:15 because we had to do the final paperwork to pay for our golf cart and wait for Terri to refuel hers. Upon arrival on 9/22, I asked if we could take care of our golf cart paperwork ahead of time, but Terri said it needed to be done closer to our departure date. Instead of alotting extra time for that the morning   of our departure, or even scheduling a time for us to come in the day before, it was initiated at 6 am — the time we were already supposed to be on the road & therefore setting us behind schedule. On the way to the boat dock, Terri decided to give a young girl a ride into town without consulting with us. This indicated a lack of concern for our time. Not only were we already running behind, but picking up the girl to drop her off at an undisclosed location only added to our stress and worry. We understand that it is customary for the locals but we didn’t really have the luxury of time at this point. Needless to say, we missed the 7am ferry by a few minutes. The next one would’ve been at 8:30am. Too late to check in for our noon flight by the time the ferry docks, collect our luggage and take a cab to the airport. Terri said she thought that the ferry would at least wait for us, which we were never under the impression that it would. Plus, that shouldn’t have been a concern since the mutual understanding was to be on time. Terri then suggested we take Maya Air to make our international flight flight by noon. An expense we didn’t foresee nor budgeted for. We had no choice but to purchase our ticket for Maya Air.

1235583172,Sari,"Hi Morgan, apologies on the confusion. I've been sick and misread the message.  You will return the cart with the same amount of gas the cart was provided. Typically they should provide with at least half a tank, but sometimes if they are very busy, with lots of rentals, they don't have time to refill carts before the next rental.  You will not be paying an extra. Ms. Terri took you to the gas station while you were in town so that you would 1. not have to worry about not having enough, and 2. know where it is in case you need to refill it while on island.  If they provided the tank with less than half, then that's how you return it.",2022-08-17 19:33:00

I understand that seasons and weather have an impact on the clarity and color of the water, but should we expect for the water to look more like what you have in your photos or should we temper our expectations. This was obviously part of the draw of Belize :-)..Thanks again!.Emily",2022-08-02 10:12:00
1245375169,Sari,Hi Emily.  I would temper expectations.  There has been an overproduction of saragossum this year.  It's unpredictable and not based on seasons but mother nature.  We do clear the beaches daily weather permitting which is more than most.  We also do have a barrier in place to limit the effects on our shore lines.  The water is still amazing and you can adventure and experience so much flaura and fish! Snorkel with sharks and sting rays or swim with manatees mother nature permitting. So much to be explored and adventured! We have the world's 2nd largest reef in the world just 200 yards from our beach! -- closest point on the entire island except for rocky point.  We're close to 2 of the marine reserves. We also have kayaks and paddle board for you to enjoy!,2022-08-02 10:59:00
