1439847141,Terri,"Hi Karinah, my name is Terri, I will be your concierge while staying with us..There are two ways to get to the island from the Belize International airport..Plane vs water taxi:..Water taxi:..Once you have landed at the international airport and finished with the customs department. Please head outside the international airport. Here you will see a variety of taxi cabs willing to take you to the water taxi terminal in Belize City (we can arrange this for you). The cost of the taxi cab is approximately 25.00 US for two persons and 10 US Dollars per additional person..After the 30 Minute taxi ride, you will get to the water taxi where you will purchase your water taxi tickets, the cost on this is 55 US Dollars round trip per person..Boat ride is 1 hr 45 min...If you allow me to book the boats for you, I can get the boat tickets at 45 US Dollars round trip per person.https://belizewatertaxi.com/.That is their web site and you can see prices...Plane:.Once you have arrived at the international airport in Belize City and cleared customs this is what will happen if you choose to come via plane. Inside the international airport you will head directly to your left you will see a kiosk that says Tropic Air, the cost is about 175 US Dollars round trip to San Pedro and back to the international airport per person. The flights leave every hour on hour from San Pedro to Belize City and Belize City to the island. The flight itself is a beautiful low flying 15 minutes over the Caribbean. If you board first, you can sit next to the pilot!..Once you decide how you wish to come down to the island, I am more than happy to book a flight for you or water taxi..Its better if I book for you, the reason is that I like that I will know what time you will be getting to the island.",2023-03-27 17:47:00

1384154834,Terri,"Hi Michelle, thank you for booking with us, my name is Terri, I will be your concierge while staying with us. ..Plane vs Water taxi to island..Plane:.Once you have arrived at the international airport in Belize City and cleared customs this is what will happen if you choose to come via plane. Inside the international airport you will head directly to your left you will see a kiosk that says Tropic Air, the cost is about 175 US Dollars round trip to San Pedro and back to the international airport per person. The flights leave every hour on the hour from San Pedro to Belize City and Belize City to the island. Technically you should be at the airport 2 hours before departing back stateside. The flight itself is a beautiful low flying 15 minutes over the Caribbean. If you board first, you can sit next to the pilot!..Water taxi:.Once you have landed at the international airport and finished with the custom department. Please head outside the international airport. Here you will see a variety of taxi cabs willing to take you to the water taxi terminal in Belize City (we can arrange this for you). The cost on the taxi cab is approximately 25.00 US for two persons and 10 US Dollars per additional person...The cost on this is 55 US Dollars per person round trip, you can purchase online at https://belizewatertaxi.com/.Or I can purchase for you at 45 US dollars per person round trip.

1197789122,Navaz,Hi Chad! I'll be visiting for our 1st year anniversary with my wife.,2022-06-04 18:44:00
1197789122,Navaz,"Hi Chad and Terri, ..hope all is well with you two.....I am just letting you know that Mary (my wife) and I are enjoying our 1st year anniversary travelling to this great vacation spot...We have both never been to Belize.... we're not ones that love to do a lot of excursions or scheduled events. We're all about going with the flow, having some great rest and a beautiful place to enjoy...We love food, but Mary had a gluten allergy and there is zero compromise around this. She loves food and doesn't always want to have salads, so that is one of the main reasons why we don't go to restaurants as much due to possible cross contamination. I'm easy with no allergies, but more food preferences,but I'm super flexible...Anyways, I'm all about transparency and want to share as much as I can...The one other caveat I have right now, is that Mary doesn't know about this trip yet. I will inform her closer to the date but want surprise her...Please let me know if you need anything from my end and I really hope this can be a memorable and fun holiday/anniversary..Thanks..Navaz",2022-06-04 18:52:00

It's officially on the 24th...Out hope during this holiday/Anniversary is to have a lot of relaxation and just easy fun...Mary had good allergies. She has a gluten allergy, so her meals are WAY more important for NO cross contamination. I do not have allergies, but more food preferences..It's still a surprise for Mary because I didn't tell her where it what we are doing yet, so if you can help me arrange things, that would be great...I would like to understand a little more if what a ""Super Host"" does...Looking forward to hearing from you...Thanks..Navaz",2022-06-05 12:56:00

1197789122,Chad,"As a super host, essentially what that means on the platform that our guests generally and consistently have a great experience staying with us - as it relates to communication, checkin, villa cleanliness, etc. We offer additional services to our guests (this isn't necessarily related to being a SuperHost) which is we help our guests on all aspects of their travel.  After you book your international flights to the Belize City International Airport, Ms. Terri can reserve your travel accommodations from the main airport to the island/San Pedro (which most guests come either by a puddle hopper flight or ferry). Terri is also a 25 year tour operator and local so she can help arrange all the tours/adventures you might be interested in doing while staying with us!",2022-06-08 17:10:00
1197789122,Navaz,This is awesome to understand and know. Really helpful,2022-06-08 17:11:00
1197789122,Chad,"Belize really is about the adventure/seeing and the experiencing of culture!  You've got the Blue Hole (one of the 7 wonders), you have Mayan Ruins, Jungle Tours such as ziplining, and Cave Tubing.  You've got water exploration: Hol Chan Marine Reserve, Shark Ray Alley, Caye Hopping (see surrounding islands), Feed the Tarpon - swim with the manatees (mother nature permitting), parasailing, jet skiing, fishing (deep sea, fly and spear)!",2022-06-08 17:12:00

1197789122,Chad,"I have to be honest - I don't think there are many GF options on the island.  What I would recommend is either hiring a chef or preparing a lot of your own meals in villa.  It is a full service kitchen...I will have Ms. Terri do some due diligence for restaurants that can accommodate her allergy.  Does she have any other food allergies, other than gluten?",2022-06-08 17:14:00
1197789122,Navaz,"No, just the gluten but it's pretty severe.,...",2022-06-08 17:17:00
1197789122,Chad,"I know there are GF options on menus at restaurants... But I couldn't guarantee that there is 0 cross contamination in the kitchens behind the scenes.  It is an island and also a developing nation, so there isn't as much general education as we are privileged with here.  I want to be candid.",2022-06-08 17:18:00
1197789122,Navaz,"How much does a private chef cost!? That's obviously above and beyond the cost I've paid so far, correct?",2022-06-08 17:18:00
1197789122,Navaz,I appreciate the full candidness....very much,2022-06-08 17:19:00

1197789122,Navaz,The corn based flour items are a fantastic substitute,2022-06-08 17:20:00
1197789122,Chad,"Yes, my wife does tons of ceviche and fish and chicken when we are there too!  Correct, Chef Services are an additional cost, as are all meals. The villa rate includes your accommodation - no meals are included.  We are partnered with GEM, the resort restaurant to the South of us - I have reached out to see what options are available.  There is also a FABULOUS French Restaurant in town - where the Chef was a stateside Michelin chef, and we have a very good relationship with him.  I am certain he would be able to provide excellent options were you to dine with him one evening.",2022-06-08 17:25:00

1197789122,Navaz,"Also, great if we could potentially find out if your chef friend could take care of us a few nights",2022-06-08 17:27:00
1197789122,Navaz,"Sorry....but I can't add Mary to this conversation, can I? I'm new to this site and was wondering if that was an option.",2022-06-08 17:29:00
1197789122,Chad,"There are definitely options other than salad! I just honestly can't guarantee all restaurants with pots/pans cooking in the restaurant kitchens in the back what they may do.  But I am pretty confident that we can count on our neighboring restaurant to make some great options, Chef Patrick, and a private Chef will definitely take care of you guys.",2022-06-08 17:30:00
1197789122,Chad,"No unfortunately not, you can't add an additional person. However, once Ms. Terri is back in action - we can start a group whats app chat/ thread..That's the best and easiest way to communicate when on island and leading up to your stay..That way everyone can be included in the chat.",2022-06-08 17:31:00

1197789122,Chad,The Tacos and Ceviche are solid staples with Corn based substitute for GF,2022-06-08 17:38:00

1065297599,Chris,Your place is beautiful!  We have never been to Belize but cannot wait to visit in July of 2022.  I do have some concerns about the seaweed and not being able to swim off the beach or off the end of the dock.  Is there a time of the year that the seaweed is not a problem?  Is it bad in July?  What type of swimming access will we have to the ocean if the seaweed is there?  I appreciate the help and want to stay with you all!,2021-11-07 18:06:00

Unfortunately with the seaweed we do not have any control as there is no season per se and this is only controlled by mother nature. With that being said, the swimming at the end of the pier is still awesome and the reef is still spectacular..As you know after all the oil spills and climate changes mother nature has been producing a lot of seagrasses and here in Belize, we are blessed that we are not as bad as other parts of the Caribbean and Mexico..With all that being said, we do promise, sand, sea, Caribbean breeze, sun and of course a bit of rain lol",2021-11-07 19:30:00

But as Terri said its difficult to predict and we have no way of knowing for certain what the conditions may be in July of 2022.  You will always have access to swim off the shoreline and the pier, and in the event seaweed may be higher than normal, you will always be able to swim and snorkel off the end of the pier.

We call this the fishing beach bbq day. On this trip you will start by fishing, spearfishing, lobster and conch hunting (if in season) and you snorkel at the reef, at the end everything that was caught will be cooked for you on the beach. Yes your son can go and will enjoy this..The cost is either 550 US dollars for up to 4 persons or 650 US dollars. Price will depend if the pick you up at the villa or in town",2022-03-20 09:18:00

1145298376,Terri,yes it is,2022-03-24 18:39:00
1145298376,Jessica,Hello!  We're getting excited for our trip & looking into all the potential activities.  The kids are very interested in visiting Hol Chan Marine Reserve & swimming with the sharks.  Is this only scheduled through tour companies?  Are there any you recommend?  Our preference would be to use local tour guides who are environmentally friendly.  Thank you!,2022-05-26 21:00:00

1145298376,Jessica,"Excellent, thank you!  June 23 or 24 work for us.",2022-05-26 22:09:00
1145298376,Terri,"Jessica, holchan is one of my favorite spots to go to. .There are about three options that you can visit the marine reserve:.1. Caye caulker day sail.On this trip you will sail towards holchan marine reserve and snorkel, then you will go to shark ray alley and swim with the sharks and rays. After we sail to caye caulker and have lunch there and visit the island a bit. .The cost on this is 95 US dollars per person plus taxes and park fees. This tour does not do pick up...2. 1/2 day snorkeling to holchan and shark Ray alley on a speed boat. .Cost is 75 US dollars per person plus taxes and park fees..Pick up at your pier included or you can meet them in town and pay 55 plus taxes and park fees US dollars per person. ..3. Grand slam. Speed boat.Snorkeling at holchan, shark ray alley and the north channel in caye caulker (if mother nature permits, you can swim with manatees and see sea horses and turtles), we also feed the tarpons and have lunch on the island of caye caulker .Cost is 650 plus taxes and park fees. Lunch not included .",2022-05-27 15:41:00
1145298376,Jessica,Thank you so much!  The second option sounds perfect as long as there's room for all four of us.  I think our boys will get a kick out of the speed boat.  How far in advance do we need to reserve?,2022-05-27 16:35:00
1145298376,Terri,"You can reserve from now, or even wait until you get here (this is risky though because there might not be space available.)",2022-05-28 11:04:00
1145298376,Jessica,"Ok, I’d like to reserve ahead of time, please. Thanks!",2022-05-31 23:43:00

1145298376,Jessica,"No problem, just thought I’d check. How bad is the sargassum there? We’re in Hopkins & it’s pretty bad. Just want to manage everyone’s expectations as we had no idea it would be like this. Thank you!",2022-06-17 18:57:00
1145298376,Chad,"Hi Jessica!  Yes, the Saragassum comes in waves. And right now it seems to be higher than normal..It's not only affecting Belize - its impacting the entire Caribbean and Mexico.  In Tulum there were videos of it piled almost 5 feet high. Same in St. Lucia..It's even now affecting the US on the Pacific Coast in San Diego. It has to do with global warming and the overproduction of it.",2022-06-17 19:00:00

1102964783,Terri,"Water taxi - After customs, you will need to step outside of the international airport and get a taxi cab to take you to the Belize City water taxi terminal, the cost of this is 25 US Dollars for two persons and 10 US Dollars per additional person (basically 65 US Dollars one way to the terminal). At the water taxi, you will purchase your boat tickets and pay about 55 US Dollars round trip per person. The taxi ride is about 30 minutes and the boat ride to the island is 1 hr 45 minutes..Imagine, you will already have a hectic travel day and if you do the water taxi you will need to add almost 2 hrs + on travel time to the island on top of your international travel time...Plane - After customs, you will walk directly to the kiosk that says Tropic Air, check in, pay for your flights, wait for your flight, and well the flight will take 15 minutes and you will be on the island :) The cost is 167.50 US Dollars per person round trip",2022-05-03 13:25:00

Please note that we do clear the beach daily, weather permitting, as the guys have been hard at work since early this morning again.  We do have a strict cancellation policy.

1111032847,Terri,"No problem, my favorite spot to snorkel is at holchan marine reserve and shark ray alley, this can be done in half-day and the cost can either be 75 US Dollars per person or 55 US Dollars per person, plus taxes and equipment and park fees. The price difference is where do you want to get picked up. .We also have half-day snorkeling to Mexico Rocks and tres cocos and the prices are the same",2022-03-07 22:01:00

1111032847,Chad,"I suggest you fly to the island after you arrive in Belize City. Ms. Terri can reserve your tickets,  you'll pick them up at the carrier desk once you go through customs and you'll pay the carrier directly when checking in and picking up your tickets upon arrival.  It's a gorgeous scenic 15 minute flight over the Caribbean.  It feels like a mini tour in and of itself and if you board first,  you can sit next to the pilot.  To charter a private boat wouldn't be cost effective. The other alternative would be to take the public ferry from the mainland to the island.",2022-03-16 13:18:00

1053532415,Chad,"Akea, the above flight information shows you arrive at 2:40pm in country. Currently your flight to the island is at 3:40pm (gives you about an hour to get through customs and pick up your luggage, check in with Tropic and go through security). I think 1 hour should be ok. I pinged Terri to confirm if she agrees.  Sometimes you can get through the airport in 30 mins, sometimes an 1 hr 20 if A LOT of planes all come in at the same time.  However, the flights are adjustable, no extra fees. In fact you can keep these flight times, and if you miss it b/c you couldn't get through customs fast enough, they put you on the next flight (no charge or change fees).",2022-01-26 11:21:00

1053532415,Akea,"Lol Gotcha. I have 3 main questions right now ..(1) Activity Bookings - how far in advance are bookings necessary is same day or next day an option? {Reef Runner Glass Bottom Boat to Hon Chan, Cave tubing, Mayan ruins etc}..(2) Flight Advice: We want to visit the Belize Museum right after we fly in around 2pm then fly to the Caye and check-in w.o the late arrival fee & before it’s dark. Based on your knowledge of time it takes to get through the airport, taxi times etc. - which flight time sounds best 4:40 or 5:40? Or does this not sound like a good plan?..(3) Golf cart travel times from villa to Secret beach, SPR airport, San Pedro, & pier for Reef Runner Boat Tour. How does parking work when we ride to location where we will be gone to extended time (ie. Water taxi station for Belize City activities, Sailing, Beach, etc)?",2022-04-10 16:19:00
1053532415,Terri,"the earlier you know about what activities you want to book the better, you are coming during the busiest time on the island..If you are arriving at 2 pm, honestly you will not make it to the museum, they close at 3 pm by the time you are done with customs the museum will be closed and it is an hour's drive to the spot itself..For your domestic flight to the island, I am more than happy to book this for you..I will give you a call tomorrow so we can chat a few minutes",2022-04-10 21:41:00

1115099230,Jim,"Hi Chad/Terri,..Couple questions: .1.  Are you gold standard?  Should I care if you're not?  .2.  Our schedule for the 11th has us potentially to Belize City late, basically we are staying in San Ignacio, and doing ATM Cave on the drive over.  Is there a way to get to Ambergris late, or should we just be on the first ferry/flight in the AM?  I'm not too price sensitive, I am not against a charter boat/plane ride over.  We aren't cancelling the night of the 11th as my worst case is we are on the 8:00 ferry/flight over and will want very early check-in.  .3.  Is there restaurants nearby?  Grocery Store?",2022-03-02 11:23:00
1115099230,Support,A message with 1 button and a title of Want to save time?,2022-03-02 11:23:00
1115099230,Chad,"1. Yes we are. - To answer your secondary question, honestly no.  They don't turn anyone away from entering the country and you can stay with friends/family, etc  - It's a way for the country to try to make more money..2. The ATM Cave will be much fun!  The last flights out are usually about 6pm - if there are flight delays, however they will fly later. The ferry typically has its last boat out  around 5:30pm.  It will certainly be easiest for you to fly over first thing in the morning and check in as soon as you arrive!  .If you rent a golf cart, Ms. Terri will greet you upon arrival and escort you to the villa. She will also help reserve your flights from the mainland over to the island. We simply need names as they appear on your passports (and your departure flight information to head back stateside) - When you arrive at the Terminal to checkin, you'll pick up your reservation under your name and pay the carrier directly. .3. We are partnered with the restaurant at the resort just South of us (neighbor) - which provides in villa room service. There is also a little place called Chat and Chill open on weekends just 300 yard stroll up the beach North of us. We also offer villa pre-stock, and chef services.  There are 3 little grocers about a quarter mile down the road.  There are plenty of other great spots along the North Road and over at Secret Beach about 20 - 30 mins golf cart ride. Terri can provide a list of great spots to check out!",2022-03-02 14:41:00
1115099230,Jim,"Hi Chad/Terri,  ..We are leaving Thursday for Central America, so I wanted to check in before we leave.  I have saved Terri's what's app phone number.  ..Basically I don't know if we are going to arrive on the last flight on the 11th or the first flight on the 12th.  I may not know until the 11th.  We are doing an early ATM tour, hence the issue.  It sounds like we will easily make it to Belize City Airport by 5:30, but??? .  ..We have rented a golf cart from you.   Does it matter to you when we land?  I'll certainly know by 3-4PM on the 11th, or is that too late?  ..How far is the drive in the golf cart from the airport to the house?  And how far away are groceries from the house?  ..Thanks!..Jim..My what's app number is 570-527-7537",2022-03-27 13:11:00
1115099230,Chad,"Hi Jim,  no worries just keep us posted as best you can in real time regarding your arrival.  We're a 35-40 min drive from San Pedro,  9 miles north (in the listing description).  The grocery stores are right in town and a couple smaller shops a quarter of a mile down the road from the villa,  which we can stop for you to shop upon arrival,  but if you're arriving on island after 6pm, it would be easier for us to do villa prestocking (in advance). If you're coming in the next morning,  shopping when you arrive won't be an issue.  Safe travels! Looking forward to hosting you!",2022-03-27 16:36:00

1109425404,Terri,"The Mayan temples are on the mainland, and there are three options to do these tours:.option one involves guides picking you up at the villa and sending you off to Belize City on the regular water taxi where a van will meet you at taking you on your tour. Breakfast and lunch included.Option two involves you going into town yourself and getting on the regular water taxi and meeting your guides at the water taxi terminal. Only lunch included.Option three involves you going into town, meeting the tour company's private boat (other people will be on the boat) getting breakfast and heading to Belize City and getting in the tour company's vans, and heading out to see the ruins. Breakfast and lunch included, you are never left alone as there is always a guide with you at all times...Lamanai Maya Ruin, this trip usually leaves at 6:30 in the morning, you will head to Belize City where a van awaits for you to take you 54 miles on the northern highway, once there you will get in on a riverboat that will go down the river, where if mother nature allows it, you will see, spider monkeys, crocodiles, manatees, different kind of birds, flora and fauna and butterflies. At the end of the river tour, you will start hiking for about 20 minutes until you reach the temples...Cave tubing and Maya Ruin Xunatunich - instead of heading north you will be heading West of the country and driving about an hr and a half to get to the caves and there you will be doing some hiking and after you will head to Xunatunich and visit the temple...Zipline and Maya Ruin (Xunatunich) same as above but instead of going to the caves we go to the Ziplines...You can also do a three 1-day tour, where you will go to do the zipline, Maya ruin (Altun ha), and Cave tubing...Prices will vary from 220 to 385 plus taxes per person",2022-03-25 23:35:00
1109425404,Sarah,"Hi Teri, this is great.  I think we have settled on the Lamanai Ruin river cruise option.  What was the price for that one?  Would scheduling that for Thursday April 7th be possible?  Are we picked up at the villa for that trip?  Thank you for all your help?",2022-03-27 19:56:00
1109425404,Sarah,This would be for us and The Nicholas… so 9 total people 4 adults and 5 children,2022-03-27 19:57:00
1109425404,Terri,"your choice on the pick up:.If you meet them in town the price is 220 US Dollars and breakfast and lunch are included. Plus taxes.If they pick you up at the villa then the cost is 285 US Dollars per person, plus taxes, breakfast, and lunch is included, the only difference is that on this one you will be on the regular water taxi and a van will be waiting for you in the city",2022-03-27 20:45:00
1109425404,Sarah,Ok we would prefer the villa pick up option if that is possible for the Thursday.  Please let me know if and how we can reserve that.  Thank you for all your help.,2022-03-29 12:53:00

We’d like to return our rental car to Goldston airport Saturday March 26 at about 1 pm and then make our way to the water taxi. Does the water taxi run all the way from that waterfront near the BZE airport to the island? And how difficult would it be for us to get from BZE airport to the water taxi. Your web page has a water taxi originating near San Pedro - is the trip from BZE more of a ferry? Would it be possible to also arrange transportation back to the BZE airport the morning of Monday March 28? If it makes more sense for me to keep the rental car those days and drive around to San Pedro, please let me know and I’ll do that..Thanks! Fraser",2022-02-26 18:02:00
1120501160,Terri,"Fraser, since you have a car rental, my suggestion is to have the golf cart company give you a ride to the water taxi terminal, if you get a taxi cab, the cost will be 25 US Dollars one way to the water taxi...At the water taxi, you will purchase the ticket, the cost is about 55 US Dollars round trip per person, the boat ride is 1 hr 45 minutes to the island. The water taxi leaves Belize City, makes a 2 minutes stop at Caye Caulker, and then it comes to San Pedro...For your return, I am more than happy to set your flight back to the international airport. I will just need your names as written on your passports and your international return time. The cost is about 90 US Dollars one way.",2022-02-27 01:30:00

Does that include both items?  Also, will they be on site or stored elsewhere?  I'm asking because you said that they can only be used if the weather is good.  We did book through White Sands Dive Shop and I told them that you referred us. We have two days booked for diving and appreciate any other recommendations that you have.  I will look at the eco-friendly iguana place.  And, I would like to purchase the local eggs that you mentioned.",2022-03-04 20:23:00

1116280978,Jennifer,"Well crap.  He already paid for it at $53 per person. Per the receipt, it looks like the airport travel is also included, but I will confirm with Lawless (husband). The total was $351 for 4 people. .Also, how much is the kayak per day vs the week?  We have some diving etc planned and not sure that we would use it daily.  Does it stay on the property if i want to go out for sunrise?  And, should we bring our own PFD's (life jackets)",2022-03-14 15:50:00
1116280978,Terri,"Oh no, it's ok though, he got it done, Yes you paid much more, tell him there goes his extra beer money LOL..The kayak and paddleboard for the entire week are 130 US Dollars, the kayak is tandem and the paddleboard is single when you use them just tell us which one you want to use for that day. if you want it for half a day it is 15 US Dollars or the full day is 25 US Dollars..The paddleboards and kayaks stay on property and you need to let us know the day before if you wish to use them so we can prepare them for you. After 2 pm is the last time you can use it and the reason is that it gets dark and the weather always changes around that time. We provide you with life jackets for the kayaks and paddle boards",2022-03-14 16:21:00
1116280978,Jennifer,Oh well.  I certainly would have booked through you if I knew the difference. Can we decide on the kayak when we get there.  Sure we will just do the weekly rate.  What time are we able to get the kayak in the am's?  We are bringing two sets of snorkeling gear but may need to rent two more sets.  Any advice on that?,2022-03-14 16:30:00

1116280978,Jennifer,"We only have two sets and I'm very petite, so I doubt our borrowed gear will fit me. We may consider buying before we leave CO.  If we don't, can that still be rented with covid?  We do have extra snorkels from a trip in Mexico last year.",2022-03-14 16:38:00

1103489689,Terri,"Good morning and hope that you are having a wonderful week and excited about coming to the island :)..First of all, do not look at the weather channel, it does not give the accurate weather for Belize, if you go in right now it will say rain this entire week, well guess what? Sun is so hot and the weather is so perfect at the moment. The weather channel reads for the entire country of Belize, and well, yes it is raining somewhere in Belize but not on the island :)..A golf cart (4-seater) for your entire stay will be 225 US Dollars plus taxes...When it comes to excursions, there is fishing, snorkeling, diving, Maya Ruins, and so much more, what was it that you were more looking for?..Dinner on the beach - we are more than happy to set this up for you, our restaurant next door will charge about 75 US Dollars per person and this can either go higher or lower, all depending on what you order. Just let me know what day you want it...We also have a private chef that comes over and she charges 200 US Dollars for her service and you pay for the groceries.",2022-03-01 11:13:00

If you don’t have a recommendation, we can do some research ourselves, but I always prefer the recommendation of a local resident, especially one in the hospitality industry, who knows the reputation of businesses in the area...Please let me know if you need any further information from us.

1014727550,Terri,"First question Kelly, when was the last time you went diving, are you all dive certified?.My favorite family-friendly activity is the beach bbq:.Imagine - Fishing, spearfishing, lobster, and conch hunting (if in season), snorkeling, and a yummy beach bbq for lunch. The cost on this is either 550 US Dollars for all three of you or 450 US plus taxes, the cost is for all three of you and not per person..Also, there is half-day snorkeling to holchan marine reserve and shark ray alley. Cost is either 75 US Dollars plus taxes plus park fees and equipment per person, or, 55 US Dollars plus taxes plus park fees and equipment per person..You might be wondering, why are there two prices? The reason is that it all depends on where you want to get picked up, if you get picked up at the villa the price is higher if you meet them in town the price is lower..Usually, on the day of your arrival, I stop at the grocery shop so you can get provisions, or, we can do a pre-stock with basic items.",2022-01-07 08:22:00

1014727550,Kelly,Thanks Terri. Jacob and I are both certified divers and it's been about two years since I last dove...It is necessary to book the activities ahead of time or can we plan it by day during our trip?..How do I pay and confirm the flights?,2022-01-09 09:17:00
1014727550,Terri,"For the flights you will be paying this upon arrival at the tropic kiosk, .If you have not dived in two years, I would suggest diving at holchan to start your diving week, the reason it is only 30 feet of water..Yes diving you can book when you get here, I honestly do not like it this way because you might run the risk of having to space, but you can do it.",2022-01-09 11:19:00
1014727550,Chad,Terri means you Run the risk of NOT having space.  You are visiting during high season and due to less providers working on the island due to covid. Trip space is limited and things can get booked.  Let us know whatever you would like to do.  Terri can reserve your excursions in advance.  You can pay for excursions or add on services via zelle or venmo in advance so we can secure your spot with deposits.  Totally your choice.,2022-01-09 11:39:00

1014727550,Kelly,"If picked up at the Villa, is it via boat?",2022-01-11 22:29:00
1014727550,Kelly,I'd like to book the fishing/lunch excursion for the Wednesday we're visiting. And snorkeling to shark alley on Thursday. I'll determine diving when we arrive and see how we're feeling as a family.,2022-01-11 22:32:00
1014727550,Kelly,I assume our daughter cannot snorkel but perhaps you can provide more insight,2022-01-11 22:32:00
1014727550,Terri,"Kelly, for testing we have the nurses come to the villa and it takes 30 minutes to get results..Yes, picked up at the villa means by boat, unless you are doing a jungle tour then by golf cart..Can she swim? My daughter who is now 21 and my son who is 16, have both been snorkeling since age 2, just try get her used to using a mask..Also, please note that we have a babysitter that can come to the villa, the cost - it does not matter if she comes for 1 hr or for 8 hrs 50 US Dollars + 20 for her transportation..Feb 5 - Sat  Arrival.Feb 6 - Sund.Feb 7 - Mond.Feb 8 - Tues.Feb 9 - Wed - Beach BBQ (let me know where you want to get picked up).Feb 10 - Thur - Holchan and shark ray alley (let me know where you want to get picked up).Feb 11 - Frid.Feb 12 - Sat.Feb 13 - Sun.Feb 14 -  Mond    Departure",2022-01-11 23:48:00
1014727550,Kelly,I appreciate the information. Let's do pick up at the villa for both days. My daughter can swim and so we'll plan on her attending both times. Thank you for the information on the babysitter. I think we'll play that by ear for the time being...What is the cost for the COVID testing at the villa? What steps would need to be taken if we tested positive at the time of departure?,2022-01-12 12:29:00
1014727550,Airbnb,A message with 1 button and a title of Avoid repeating instructions,2022-01-12 12:29:00
1014727550,Terri,"The cost if you get tested at the villa or at the clinic is 75 usd per person. If you end up testing positive which we pray no. Then I will book a hotel for you that has an on-site restaurant and 5 days after you can re test. Once you test negative then you can leave. If you feel that it was a false positive we call the second clinic they are 100 per person if they come to you and have them test you 2 days after. I will call you later today when I'm home, to explain how this will work.",2022-01-12 12:39:00
1014727550,Kelly,"All good. That's not entirely necessary at this time; however, if you feel there is important information feel free to give a call. I feel confident in our vaccination status and understanding of measures to minimize risk that this should not be a hurdle. I also feel more confident in knowing the cost of testing and next steps if that was to be a positive result.",2022-01-12 15:39:00

1037161420,Terri,"Clint, just reaching out to see if you need any help",2021-11-18 15:25:00

1037161420,Clint,"Hi Terri and Chad-sorry for the delayed response.  We have been in the middle of a winter storm. Our flight on Friday has been canceled. There is a chance we could fly out on Saturday or Sunday, but it would depend on road conditions as we have a 9 hour drive to the airport.  .For the water taxi, what are our options? How far in advance do we need to book?",2022-02-03 09:33:00
1037161420,Terri,Oh no. The last water taxi to the island from Belize City is at 5:30 pm,2022-02-03 11:03:00
1037161420,Clint,Ok.  We will keep you updated on whether we can make it or not.  We should know more tomorrow as we watch the weather and road conditions.   I messaged you on what’sapp.  Please let me know if you received it.,2022-02-03 11:05:00
1037161420,Clint,"Unfortunately we are going to have to cancel this trip.  Flight has been canceled and our weather is horrible and travel is not safe.  We are terribly disappointed.  I understand your refund policy, that we will receive the housekeeping fee back.   We also paid for the golf cart and would like to ask if that could be refunded.  Thanks for your consideration. Please let me know the resolution before I officially cancel the reservation on airbnb.",2022-02-03 17:00:00
1037161420,Chad,Oh no Clint!  We are so sorry that you have to cancel!  Are you certain you have to cancel entirely vs arriving a few days late?  We could extend your stay an extra day with a check out of Saturday the 12th if that helps at all.,2022-02-03 18:52:00
1037161420,Chad,That of course is a free courtesy extension to help offset having to arrive late.,2022-02-03 18:53:00
1037161420,Clint,Thank you for your offer.  We are trying to see if we could fly out on Sunday and stay until Saturday.  However we are having issues finding a location that will do a Covid rapid test.   I see that we can get a Covid test at the airport in Belize instead of getting one  here in the states before we leave. Are you familiar with that option?,2022-02-03 19:56:00
1037161420,Terri,"Clint just saw your message on Whatsapp, please keep us posted, if you will be able to still make it.",2022-02-03 21:38:00
1037161420,Chad,"Hey Clint, yes,  you can always take a covid test at the airport if you can't find a facility day before departure.  I believe it's $50 to do that at the airport.",2022-02-03 22:05:00
1037161420,Chad,You can also take a pcr within 3 days of traveling as well.,2022-02-03 22:05:00
1037161420,Chad,Which is also acceptable,2022-02-03 22:06:00
